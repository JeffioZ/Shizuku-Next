/**
 * The things done *to* files, as opposed to with them.
 *
 * All of it runs here rather than in the service, which is a decision worth stating: the service
 * hands over descriptors and nothing else, so a copy is one process reading and writing through
 * two of them. That is what makes progress and cancelling possible at all - the app knows how far
 * along it is because it is the one moving the bytes - where a copy implemented in the service
 * would be a blocking call with nothing to report until it finished.
 *
 * Every operation stops at the first thing it cannot do and says which. A half-finished copy or a
 * zip missing its last entry is worse than a failure, because a failure is a thing a person can
 * see and do something about.
