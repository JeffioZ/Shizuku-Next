/**
 * What can be *done* to the saved wifi networks, as the shell does it.
 *
 * Reading the list is [WifiPasswords], which is one privileged binder call because the keys are
 * not in any output an app or a shell command prints. Doing something to a network is the other
 * way round: the platform's own `cmd wifi` already speaks every operation wanted here - it lists
 * networks with the ids the platform knows them by, forgets one by that id, and connects to one
 * given a security type and a passphrase - and it is written to be run by exactly the uid this
 * app borrows. So there is no hidden interface to reach for and no shape to guess at, and what
 * the app adds is the absent half: the key, which only the privileged read can produce.
 *
 * Every operation is checked rather than trusted. `cmd wifi` prints nothing on success and little
 * on failure, and exits 0 for both, so a write that reports itself done is not evidence that it
 * was: each one re-reads the list afterwards and answers with what is now true. That is also why
 * the results are counts and booleans rather than throwables - the caller shows a person what
 * happened, and "the network is gone from the list" is the thing that happened.
