/**
 * Installing an app, as a command line.
 *
 * The whole feature is this: `pm` is already a program that installs packages, the shell is
 * already allowed to run it, and this app already has a shell. So nothing here is a package
 * installer - there is no session to babysit, no intent the system asks the user about, and no
 * claim to be the thing Android routes installs through. A screen collects the flags and a button
 * runs the command.
 *
 * What that buys is the part `pm` is ordinarily used for and a person on a phone cannot reach: the
 * flags. Replacing an older build, allowing a downgrade, granting every permission on the way in,
 * naming a different installer so an app believes it came from somewhere it did not, installing
 * for every user at once. Without the shell those are a cable and a terminal.
 *
 * Split packages are where the one command becomes several, and they are still shell commands:
 * `pm install-create`, one `install-write` per split, `install-commit`. The four are run as one
 * script so the session id never has to travel through this process.
