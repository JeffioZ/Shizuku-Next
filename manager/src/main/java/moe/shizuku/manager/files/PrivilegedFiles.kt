/**
 * Files, opened as the shell.
 *
 * The app cannot open `Android/data/com.whatsapp` and a rooted phone is not a requirement, but the
 * adb shell can - so this asks Shizuku for a process of its own running as that shell, and does
 * the work there. What comes back over the binder is what matters: a real [ParcelFileDescriptor],
 * seekable and readable by this process, rather than the bytes of a file piped through a second
 * shell command.
 *
 * The service is bound once and kept; the binder dying drops it, and the next call binds again.
 * Every call here blocks on a binder round trip and is meant to be made from a background
 * dispatcher - [list] and [open] are the same shape as any other IO.
 *
 * Nothing in here decides what may be reached. The uid decides, the platform refuses what it
 * refuses, and a refusal arrives as [IOException] carrying the platform's own words.
