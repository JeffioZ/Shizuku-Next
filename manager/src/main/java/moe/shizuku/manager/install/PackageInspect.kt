/**
 * What a package says about itself, before any of it is installed.
 *
 * Everything here comes out of the APK: the name it will install as, its version, the Android it
 * was built for, and what it will ask for. That order matters - knowing that a file is version
 * 1.4.3.6 built for Android 12 and wants the camera is what decides whether to install it at all,
 * and after the install the decision has already been made.
 *
 * The parsing is the platform's own [PackageManager.getPackageArchiveInfo], which is the only
 * thing that reads a manifest the way the installer will. It takes a *path*, though, and this app
 * cannot read the paths it deals in - that is the whole reason it has a shell - so the package is
 * copied through one of the shell's descriptors into a file this app owns, read there, and the
 * copy thrown away. The alternative is a binary manifest parser of our own, which is a great deal
 * of code to arrive at the same answer by a different route.
 *
 * The copy is the price of showing this before installing. It is made in the app's own cache -
 * the one place nothing has to be asked about, and nothing is left behind.
